# Final Project Proposal

## Overview
I plan to recreate the game Curveball 3D in JavaFX. It is a 3D version of the classic game Pong. Rather than being played in a 2D plane, the environment is a square prism-shaped tunnel with the players on opposite square sides. Similar to Pong, players use paddles to hit the ball back and forth, trying to prevent the opponent from returning it, which costs them a life. [Here](https://www.coolmathgames.com/blog/curve-ball-3d-a-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-our-new-arcade-game/nav) is information about the game on CoolMathGames. I chose this game because I wanted to challenge myself and implement 3D graphics, and this would be a good starting point.

## Objectives
* Create a working 3D ball, paddle, and corridor environment. 
* Implement realistic ball physics, including velocity, deflection, and spin.
* Track player input to control the paddle smoothly.
* Add basic scoring and progression.
* Develop simple opponent logic.
* Document progress and keep updated repository.

## Expected Challenges
Key challenges include implementing stable collision mechanics, especially at high velocities. This was the hardest part of Brick Breaker for me, but I’m prepared to approach this using vector math rather than edge detection this time. Another challenge will be ensuring the 3D perspective behaves consistently, as this will be my first time attempting something like this.
